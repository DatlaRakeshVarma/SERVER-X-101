## Problem Statement

There are some stalls m in VISTA EVENT 2k23. In those m stalls, only n were available for auction. Each stall contains a Stall Number, and each stall is placed based on its stall number in increasing order. There are k groups interested in buying the stalls, but they don't want other group members who came for the auction with them to get nearby stalls.

Your task is to assign k stalls to the k groups such that the minimum distance between any two of the stalls is maximized. The distance between two stalls is the difference between the two stall numbers.

**Input Format**

* The first line contains the number of test cases (`T`). Each testcase contains two lines:
  * The first line contains two integers `N` (number of stalls available) and `k` (number of groups interested to buy stalls).
  * The second line contains an array `A` of size `n` which contains Stall Numbers.

**Output Format**

* Print the maximum possible minimum distance.

**Constraints**

* 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^3
* 1 ≤ k ≤ N ≤ 10^6
