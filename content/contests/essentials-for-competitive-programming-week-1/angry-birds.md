##### Problem Statement

Angry Birds is a famous game where there is a flock of birds referred by the same name trying to save their eggs from green-colored pigs. The angry bird fires on the pigs using a device called a slingshot. This slingshot is used to fire the angry birds onto the pigs. But now there is a small change in the game. Multiple birds can be launched simultaneously.

Each angry bird will have an angriness defined. There is a group of birds standing at the slingshot. The player who is playing the game needs to send the angry birds in ‘k’ groups, such that the sum of the maximum angriness of a group of birds is minimum.

You need to help the player in making an optimal choice of ‘k’ so that he can get the maximum points.

**Input Format**

* The first line contains a number of test cases T.
* The second line contains N-the size of the array, K. The elements in the array.

**Output Format**

* Output the sum of the maximum angriness of a group of angry birds which is minimum.

**Constraints**

* 1 <= T <= 100
* 1 <= N <= 1000
* 1 <= K <= 1000
* 1 <= A[i] <= 1000
