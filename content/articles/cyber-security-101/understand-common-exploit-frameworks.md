Exploit frameworks are essential tools in the cybersecurity landscape, as they provide a systematic and efficient way to test vulnerabilities, develop exploits, and launch attacks. They automate many tasks and help security professionals and ethical hackers to identify weaknesses, simulate attacks, and strengthen defenses. In this section, we will discuss some of the most common exploit frameworks and their features.
