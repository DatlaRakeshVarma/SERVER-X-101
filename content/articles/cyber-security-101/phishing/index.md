Phishing is an attempt to obtain sensitive information, such as login credentials or credit card details, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity. This usually occurs via email. The attacker often creates an email that appears to be from a reputable source, such as a bank, social media platform, or even a known contact. The email may contain a link that directs the victim to a fake website, where they are asked to enter their credentials or other sensitive information.

## How to protect yourself

* Be cautious when opening emails from unknown senders

* Look for suspicious signs in the email, such as poor grammar or inconsistencies in branding
* Always hover over links in emails to check the actual URL before clicking
* Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your online accounts
